# Functional Program Design in Scala
Functional Programming in Scala Specialisation - Functional Program Design in Scala

## About the course

In this course you will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications. You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. Youâ€™ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.

Several parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using infinite data structures or functional reactive programming.

Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

. recognize and apply design principles of functional programs,
. design functional libraries and their APIs,
. competently combine functions and state in one program,
. understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine 
   functions and state,
.  write simple functional reactive applications
